<h1 align="center">Weather Change in Australian Over 8 Years</h1> 

<p align="center">Project Description</p>
This project is on weather change in Australia from the year 2009 to the year 2016. 
This project explains the inter-dependency of weather elements & impact on each other. 
The focus is to see the effect caused by Global warming on the weather elements. 


The dataset was dowmloaded from Kaggle.


The data information:

After cleaning the dataset:

The weather elements – Temperature, Humidity & Rain have a direct or indirect impact on each other.

Australia has four seasons, with very pleasant weather. But in the years 2013 & 2014, the temperature increased making the hottest years among 8 years.

This gives us a hint that one or more factors affect weather in Australia. Parts of Australia vary in climates due to its large geographical size. The reason for the increase in temperature can be established further with a bigger dataset and area-wise analysis.

The northern part of Australia has very high wind compared to other parts of Australia. To look into the reason we need details of the landscape.

To summarize the correlation between the weather elements I have used the Pearson correlation
