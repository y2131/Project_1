<h1 align="center">Australian Weather Change Over 8 Years</h1> 

<p align="center">Project Description</p>
This project is on weather change in Australia from the year 2009 to the year 2016. 
This project explains the inter-dependency of weather elements & impact on each other. 
Focus is to see the effect caused by Global warming on the weather elements. 

I have downloaded the dataset from Kaggle.


The data information:

After cleaning the dataset:

The weather elements – Temperature, Humidity & Rain have direct or indirect impact each other.

Australia have four seasons, with a very pleasant weather. But in year 2013 & 2014 the temperature increased making the hottest years among 8 years.

This gives us a hint that one or more factors affecting weather in Australia. Parts of Australia vary in climates due to its large  geographical size. The reason for the increase in temperature can be established further with a bigger dataset and area wise analysis.

Northern part of Australia have very high wind compared to other parts of Australia. To look in to the reason we need details of the land scape.

To summarize the correlation between the weather elements I have used Pearson correlation
